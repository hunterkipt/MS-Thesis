\section{What I worked on last week}
\bi
\item I wrote the program for Generating frame deleted videos. Currently it exists as three functions. One function takes a video and dumps the frames to a specified directory, while a second takes video frames from the dump function and reencodes them into a video. The third function takes in a video to be decoded, start and end frames, and the output file path, and creates the frame deleted video.
\item I started writing the prediction error data gathering function.
\end{itemize}


\section{Problems I encountered}
\bi
\item FFMPEG liked to give me trouble. There were a few different bugs I had to sort out in order to finish the frame deletion program.
\end{itemize}

\section{What I plan to do this week}
\bi
\item I will use my frame deletion program to generate a small dataset ~250-500 videos for sanity checking purposes
\item In addition, I will finish the prediction error data gathering function, and run it on my dataset. I will perform some preliminary analysis and ensure that everything is working correctly.
\end{itemize}
