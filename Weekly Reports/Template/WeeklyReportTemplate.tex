\section{What I worked on last week}
\bi
\item I went ahead and completed the readings for both papers on frame deletion. I was able to finalize my understanding of the material and know how the detection algorithm should be programmed.
\item I spoke with Dr. Shackleford and obtained access to H.264 Poker
\end{itemize}


\section{Problems I encountered}
\bi
\item I got pretty sick last week, and was unable to make significant progress on actually using FFMPEG on our video data. This is because I had around 36 hours of homework to do between last Thursday and Today. 
\end{itemize}

\section{What I plan to do this week}
\bi
\item This week I plan of figuring out how to use FFMPEG to automatically delete frames from a video and reencode them. If I complete this, I will then write a bash script to run FFMPEG on a couple of camera models to create a small data set.
\item If time permits (I still have to make up a lot of homework, and study for midterms next week), I will also delve into h.264 poker's python interface and write a function that outputs the p-frame prediction error sequence to a text or csv type file.
\end{itemize}
