\chapter{Introduction}

In the current environment, global smartphone adoption has reached record levels. More than X\% of people worldwide are expected to own a smartphone in the next Y years \cite{}. Effectively, a large portion of people have access to a camera on their person at all times. Not only that, but the widespread adoption of social media has led to individuals sharing unprecedented amounts of information about themselves and current events with hundreds to thousands of followers.

One notable problem with this is that the prevalence of misinformation has increased to the point where the default assumption for anything seen on the internet is that the content is falsified. As such, there is a massive demand for evidence supporting claims on the internet. To this end, images and video are often supplied alongside news articles or social media posts to validate claims.

Widespread availability of video and photo editing software has allowed people to make visually convincing forgeries
